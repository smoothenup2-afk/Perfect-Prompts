Perfect! Here’s the exact prompt you can use in Google AI Studio (App Maker) to generate your “Our Cricket” app with all the professional stats, career-bests, daily totals, player profiles with images, and credit line. I’ve adapted it for Google AI Studio’s app creation style:

⸻

📱 Google AI Studio App Prompt — “Our Cricket”

Prompt:

Create a simple, clean, and professional mobile app named “Our Cricket” for tracking cricket statistics of 6 players:
Himanshu, Kuldeep, Monti, Ronaldo, Jitu, Dilip.

The app should allow entering daily totals per player and automatically calculate professional cricket stats, including career-best records.

Credit: At the bottom of the app (Home or About page), display:
“Created by Himanshu Singh Rajput”

This is ready to paste in Google AI Studio for app generation.

If you want, I can also create a ready-to-use Google Sheet template linked to this app, so the app will auto-calculate stats instantly — fully plug-and-play.

Do you want me to make that sheet next?
